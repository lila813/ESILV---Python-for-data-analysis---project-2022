# ESILV---Python-for-data-analysis---project-2023 :
## Estimation of obesity levels based on eating habits and physical condition

We were given a dataset for this project, on which we had to perform data visualization and machine learning, as well as implement the best selected machine learning model into an API. We also had to find a problematic concerning our dataset.
The dataset we were given was "ObesityDataSet_raw_and_data_sinthetic.csv", about the different habits of thousands of individuals and their weight index (ranging from "Insufficient Weight" to "Obesity Type II").
Mathilda took care of the data cleaning and visualizations, while Lila did the data cleaning the machine learning part and the API part.

### 1. Data  visualization

Concerning the visualization, we were able to assert that this or that variable is determining or not: we were able to study the features of the population (weight, height, age, gender, family history, according to the status).
Then we could study the consumption habits of the individuals (eating between meals, smoking, drinking alcohol, transport used). 
All this could be visualized by numerous plots (pie plots, histograms,...).

### 2. Machine Learning

For this part, we tested several classification models: Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and XGBoost. After performing accuracy calculations, we concluded that the best model was GXBoost, which we then implemented in our API. 

### 3 - L'API

We used Dash, implementing the following concept: following a questionnaire, the user can estimate his weight index or his risk to suffer from obesity in the future.

### 4 - Conclusion

During this project, we were able to use various libraries that we had discovered during the Practical Works of the semester.
