# ESILV---Python-for-data-analysis---project-2023 :
## Estimation of obesity levels based on eating habits and physical condition

We were given a dataset for this project, on which we had to perform data visualization and machine learning, as well as implement the best selected machine learning model into an API. We also had to find a problematic concerning our dataset.
The dataset we were given was "ObesityDataSet_raw_and_data_sinthetic.csv", about the different habits of thousands of individuals and their weight index (ranging from "Insufficient Weight" to "Obesity Type II").
Mathilda took care of the data visualization, while Lila did the data cleaning, the machine learning part and the API part.
